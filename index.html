                Potter, Harry Potter spent the first year of his life with his parents in Godric's Hollow in hiding
                because of a prophecy that was foretold about a child that would be born and eventually grow up to kill
                Voldemort. They were in a magical hiding place that can only be found if there secret keeper gives up
                the location where they are hiding, as they were being hunted by the powerful dark wizard Lord
                Voldemort, who believed Harry was destined to kill him. On the Halloween after his first birthday, the
                Potter's home location was given to Voldemort by their secret keeper, Peter Pettigrew (although the plot
                set a false trail in the Prisoner of Azkaban, causing Harry and everyone else to mistakenly believe that
                it was Sirius Black who disclosed this information), who was a Death Eater secretly working for
                Voldemort, whom proceeded to kill Lily and James. He attempted to kill Harry as well, but failed when
                the killing curse rebounded on him, apparently killing him and leaving Harry unscathed save for a
                lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Harry was then sent to live with his maternal aunt and
                uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley. They raised him for ten years, which were unhappy due to their
                tendency to verbally abuse and neglect him.</p>

            <p data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">Harry is a wizard of
                exceptional talent, and is able to wield magic to a variety of effects. He is particularly gifted in the
                area of Defence Against the Dark Arts, and is a very talented duelist. He was capable of producing a
                full Patronus at the age of thirteen, an ability that is rare even among adult wizards. He was capable
                of speaking Parseltongue, the language of snakes, but lost this ability after the fragment of
                Voldemort's soul was destroyed. He is a gifted Quidditch player, and skilled on a broom. He was the
                youngest seeker in a century. He is the first known Master of Death, as he was in possession of all of
                the Deathly Hallows and sought not to conquer death, but to face it. He is in possession of the
                Invisibility Cloak, but no longer possesses the Elder Wand or Resurrection Stone.</p>
